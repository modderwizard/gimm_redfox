# RedFox (Fall 2018 - Individual Game Project)

This is the individual project I created for the GIMM 110 class in Fall 2018. 

The initial commit of this project will contain the code in the state it was when it was turned in.

Any code changes afterwards will only be in the interest of maintaining compatability with recent
Flash Player and Adobe Animate versions.

The project requires the GreenSock library. Just drop "greensock.swc" into the root folder and it should run.
